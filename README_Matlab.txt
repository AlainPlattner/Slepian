After starting Matlab, run

initialize

to add the slepian_* folders to your path and to set the variables. 
This is necessary every time you start Matlab to use the Slepian functions.

The m-file "vectordemos.m" contains a few demos. To run it, save it in the same folder 
as the script "setup.sh" and within Matlab, run

vectordemos(1)

etc.
