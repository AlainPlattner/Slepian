To install the software on a windows machine you first need to install:

Git:
https://git-scm.com/download/win

wget:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/wget/1.11.4-1/wget-1.11.4-1-setup.exe/


After cloning Slepian, run

setup_windows.bat

This only needs to be done once.

Then follow the instructions from either README_Matlab.txt or README_Octave.txt
